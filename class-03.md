- [x] a
- [ ] b
- [ ] c

## Review from Reading 02 - Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73)
- [ ] Arrays can store a list of values.
- [ ] You can store multiple data types in the same variable!
- [ ] Use loop to write out all items in an array.

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” from switch statements on (pp.162-182)
- [ ] Switch statements can be more performant than if/else.
- [ ] Do While loops perform the code block at least once
- [ ] For loops and While loops differ because the later requires you know the number of iterations (?)
- [ ] You use a if/else to check if an element exists on a page (if it exists, it will be truthy). However it returns an object if the element exists so it is truthy rather than true (a strict equality would not evaluate to true).
- [ ] Put a while loop as a code block after an if/else: the while loop runs if the if/else condition is met 
- [ ] NAN, undefined, null are falsey
